# Abilities

## General Information
Abilities in Mythfall are equippable pieces of gear that at a cost of some [Mana]() allow the player to cast powerful spells that can either damage their foes, protect them from harm, or even provide a temporary increase to their stats.
Every ability is seperated into three pages and the book itself. Whilst the pages have to be obtained as loot from [Bosses](), the tome has to be crafted at the [Librarian]() NPC using three pages of the same type.
Every ability has an assigned dungeon it can be obtained from and each page can appear as an equipment reward from defeating the boss.
The more difficult the dungeon a particular ability appears in, the more powerful it and its effect are.

## Trivia
- At one point, the developer - UnitOfTime - , had to stop all of the spellbooks from being obtainable for the purpose of reworking them. They were readded to the game and overhauled on the 24.02.2024.
