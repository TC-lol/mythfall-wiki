# Spellbooks

## General Information
Spellbooks in Mythfall are equippable pieces of gear, that at a cost of some [Mana]() allow the player to cast powerful spells that can either damage their foes, or protect them from harm.

## Types of Spellbooks
Currently, there is only one type of spellbook, that can be obtained by players, [The Tome of Flame](./tomeOFlame.md), which every players starts with.

## Trivia
- At one point, the developer - UnitOfTime - , had to stop all of the spellbooks from being obtainable for the purpose of reworking them.
