# Potions

## General characteristics
Potions are liquid filled vials, that upon being drunk grant the player a temporary benefit, for example: a heal.
Most of the potions posses the following features:
- Can not be crafted by palyers, but only obtained by killing [monsters]() and [bosses]().
- Can be upgraded at the [apothecary]() in the [hub]() by using a corresponding [resource](../../resources/resources.md) until the maximum level.

## Types of Potions
Currently in the game, there are only four types of potions, with all of them granting the player a heal, depending on their level.
Those are:
- [The Cocofruit Milk](./cocofruitMilk.md)
- [The Small Health Potion](./SHPotion.md)
- [The Health Potion](./HPotion.md)
- [The Large Health Potion](./LHPotion.md)

A noteworty thing to mention is, that The [Cocofruit Milk](./cocofruitMilk.md) is the only type of potion which can be only crafted by players, as well as cannot be upgraded.
