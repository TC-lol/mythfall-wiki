# Resources

## General Information
Resources in Mythfall are various items, only obtainable by defeating certain [Monsters]() and [Bosses](), that players can use to craft [Armour](../armours/armours.md), [Hats](../hats/hats.md), [Weapons](../weapons/weapons.md) and [Potions](../potions/potions.md) alike.
The resources the player can obtain from each monster they kill depends on the [biome]() the said monster primarily appears in.

Resources can be used to craft many things, most of them can be used at the [Blacksmith]() located in the overworld in order to craft and upgrade many different types of equipment.
