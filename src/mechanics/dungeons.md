# Dungeons
Dungeons are a way to fight unique bosses and mobs, and are the primary way to get unique items.

## How do I find a dungeon?
An enterance portal to a dungeon may be triggered to spawn by either killing normal enemies inside of the Alivarg's sphere until one spawns, or killing a World Boss inside of the said sphere, which is guaranteed to spawn a portal upon its death - portals created by killing World Bosses always lead to much stronger dungeons. The said portal will disappear after a period of 4 minutes. The type of portal that spawns differs based on the mob killed and which area the mob is in.

> *Dungeons are randomly generated and feature multiple rooms leading to a boss fight. The amount of skulls indicates the difficulty of the dungeon.*

## Dungeons' ranks
Despite each dungeon being different from each other, they are all grouped up into difficuly ranks, which are displayed displayed as below a dungeons name, and help Players with assesing the danger level - the more skulls a dungeon has, the harder it is.
Difficulty ranks range from 0 skull, up to 5.
Here is a description of what can be expected to find in a dungeon of a specific rank:
- 0 skulls - The easiest ones. Enemies posses minuscule amounts of health, their shots are slow and far in between, and most of them only have one attack pattern. The bullets themselves are slim and always deal one point of damage. The dungeon itself is easy enough, that someone with nothing but a stick, who has already had some experiance with bullet hells, can clear it with only some difficulty. There is only one dungeon in this difficulty rank, namely the [Pirate Cove]() which can be considered to be more of a tutorial dungeon than a proper one.
- 1 skull - The dungeons for beginners. Enemies posses small amount of health, their shots are somewhat frequent, and may posses up to two attack patterns. The bullets themselves are of noraml size, or are bigger, but slower and vice versa. They always deal one point of damage and always travel on a straight line (except for some bossses). The dungeon itself is a little more difficult, it is advised to equip gear of, at least, the same tier as the ores that can be obtained from the region that dungeon can be found in. In this difficulty rank, there are the following dungeons:
	- [The Eldertree Forest]();
	- [The Stoneheart Forest]();
	- [The Elvenwood Forest]().
- 2 skulls - The itermediate dungeons. Enemies posses ample health, their shots contain way more bullets, are more frequent, and may posses up to two attack patterns. The bullets themselves are of the standerd size and shape and always travel in a straight line. Most of them deal one point af damage, but ones that can deal two start to appear. The dungeon itself is much more difficult, there is a tangible danger of dying inside of it. It is advised to equip at least obsidian tier gear and pieces of equipment received as rewards for beating one skull dungeons. An ample amount of skill is also advised. In this difficulty rank, there are the following dungeons:
	- [The Grug Pit]();
	- [The Slime Pit]().
- 3 skulls - The advanced dungeons. Enemies posses high health, their shots contain less bullets, but are very frequent, and may posses up to two attack patterns. The bullets themselves are of the standerd size and shape, and may form simple patterns (ex: orbitting one another). Most of them deal two points af damage, the ones that deal one damage appear way less, and ones that deal three damage start to appear. The dungeon itself is much more difficult, there is a high risk of dying inside of it. It is advised to equip your best gear, as well as increase your stats with stat crystals a bit, before attempting to beat it. You need to be skilled at the game to clear it - the equipment itself will no longer suffice. In this difficulty rank, there are the following dungeons:
	- [The Hanging Temple]().
- 4 skulls - The expert dungeons. Enemies posses enormous amount health, their shots contain a lot of bullets and are very frequent, and may posses up to two attack patterns. The bullets themselves are of the standerd size and shape, and may form intricate patterns, or home onto a player's position. They all deal either two or three damage - the ones that do one no longer appear. The dungeon itself is incredibly difficult, you will most likely die inside of it at least once. It is advised to equip your best gear, as well as increase your stats with stat crystals as much as You can, before even thinking about beating it. You need to be highly skilled at the game to clear it - even a single mistake may lead to the demise of your character. In this difficulty rank, there are the following dungeons:
	- [The Anubis Temple]();
	- [The Succubus Lair]().
- 5 skulls - The Master dungeons. There currently are no dungeons of this difficulty in the game, as such, a decription of this difficulty rank cannot be created. 

## Dungeon's anotomy
Each dungeon always contains the following rooms:

![Dungeon Enterance](../images/dungEnter.png)
> *An example of a dungeon enterance room.*

- An enterance room, consisting of:
	- A teleport leading to this dungeon's enterance portal in the Alivarg's sphere;
	- At least one hallway exit leading to a combat room.

![Dungeon Boss Room](../images/dungBoss.png)
> *An example of a Boss room.*
	
- A Boss room, consisting of:
	- A Boss rorresponding to the type of the dungeon it's in;
	- At least one hallway exit leading to a combat room.
	
![Dungeon Combat Room](../images/dungCombat.png)
> *An example of a Combat room.*
	
- From 10 to 18 combat rooms, depending on the dungeon's generation, each one consisting of:
	- At least two hostile mobs;
	- At least one hallway exit leading the next room, blocked with a one-way barrier.
	- The further from the enterance a Combat room is positioned, the harder it is overall.
	
Besides that, there are some rules that govern the layout of each dungeon:
- The entireity of the dungeon is assembled from preexisting rooms.
- There are always at least one combat room between the enterance and the Boss in each dungeon.
- Each room inside of a dungeon can be accessed noramlly ( there are no unconnectedd rooms).
- Each room is connected to other rooms via a "path" that overrides all and any walls that happen to be on top of it.

## Traversing a dungeon
Upon entering any dungeon, One is teleported to the enterance room of that dungeon.
The goal of each dungeon delve is to reach the boss room and defeat the Boss within it - it can only be reached by traversing and clearing the combat rooms.
After clearing a combat room, the barrier to the next set of rooms will disapear and you will be able to enter the next room. Parties of multiple people will find health of the mobs in the rooms (including the boss) increased by **50%** of their original health for each Player inside of that room.

![Dungeon Room Barrier](../images/dungeon_room_barrier.png)
> *A room barrier still being up, the player can not proceed untill all mobs are cleared.*

After reaching the boss room, the Player or the Party is faced with a dangerous fight against that dungeon's Boss - surviving and defeating it is the only way to obtain the reward for clearing a dungeon.

## Boss item drops
After defeating the Boos, each Player who contributed to defeating it receives their reward inside of a chest, which appears in the middle of the boss room and is only accesible by them to prevent stealing someone else's loot.
To be able to get a boss item drop, One needs to do a minimum of **10%** of the damage to the boss's total health.

![DungeonChest](../images/dungChest.png)

Each chest for defeating a Boss contains:
- A health [potion](../items/consumables/potions/potions.md) of a tier corresponding with the dungeon's rank, which is:
	- No potion for clearing a 0 skull dungeon;
	- A [Small Health Potion](../items/consumables/potions/SHPotion.md) for clearing a 1 skull dungeon;
	- A [Health Potion](../items/consumables/potions/HPotion.md) for clearing a 2 skull dungeon;
	- A [Large Health Potion](../items/consumables/potions/LHPotion.md) for clearing a dungeon with 3 or more skulls.
- A [jelly](../items/resources/resources.md) of a tier corresponding with the dungeon's rank, which is:
	- A [Green Jelly](../items/resources/GJelly.md) for clearing either a 0 or 1 skull dungeon;
	- A [Blue Jelly](../items/resources/BJelly.md) for clearing a dungeon with 2 or more skulls.
- One of many unique pieces of equipment, that can be obtained from that particular boss, with varying chances, which:
	- Are guaranteed from dungeons with **less** than 3 skulls, **but** may be replaced with a piece of an ore, whose type varies from dungeon to dungeon, if one is unlucky enough;
	- Have 10% chance of appearing in dungeons with 3 or more skulls.

## Tips and some advice for expolring Dungeons
Dungeons, by nature, are incredibly dangerous places that may vanquish anyone not preparred enough to conquer them.
Fortunately, there are some tricks that might js=ust save You on the next dungeon delve, as well as spare You the unnecessary anxiousness.

- **Spare healing** - No matter whether One is trying to conquer a completly new dungeon, or is doing the 100th run of the same one, One should always carry some healing in a case of an emergency - accidents do happen, and that extra healing might just save your life.
- **Retreating** - Whenever One is in a dungeon and has little health left, thay should ask themselves whether thay are able to keep going and beat the Boss, and more importantly, wthether it is worth the risk of losing their equipment and stats - don't be afraid of retreating, once You return, You'll be stronger and better, and will be able to clear it.
- **Watching one's health** - Whenever One is engaged in combat, they should always be mindful of the state of their health, as even a single moment of distraction might prove fatal - You should always be ready to heal yourself in case of an emergency, also it is reasonable to recall mid-fight if You can only take three more hits, as this much health would allow You to tank the hits while recalling, which might prove fatal if attempted with less health.
- **Exploring new Dungeons** - If One wants to attempt to clear a dungeon, that they haven't beaten before, it is eagerly advised for them to equip their best gear and bring as many potions as they can, taking a [Book of Stone](../..items/abilities/bookOStone.md) is also a great idea, as it can provide invalueable shielding while retreating - it really is better to be safe than sorry.
- **Room scouting** - Room scouting might prove invalueable wile One is exploring the more difficult Dungeons, as it allows One to avoid the risk of entering a combat room that is essentially a dead end and losing some priceless health points, as well as reaching the bossroom itself faster. It is more of a strategy of clearing dungeons than a simple advice - it relies on:
	- **Scouting for dead ends**: The minimap gives a wider view of the surrounding area, even in dungeons - by carefully approaching the next room's barrier, but not entering it, allows one to see on the minimap whether it leads further, or is just a dead end which can be told apart by:
		 -A: A hole in the opposite wall of the room;
		 -B: Absence or deformation of one of the rooms characteristic features that has been overridden by the beforementioned "path", that leads to the next room.
	  If the minimap can't show the entireity of the room, and the room doesn't posses any walls in the middle rhat could've been overridden, the room might still contain a hallway to the next one, but it is better to check the others first.
	- **Optimazing the exploration** - The order One chooses the rooms they explore shuld suit their needs - if You want to reach the Boss quickly, You ought to choose the room with the highest amount of hallways, but if You desire to preserve your health for later, it is advised You explore the ones with the least amount of enemies, or ones that are easy to handle ( the explored room should still posses a hallway to the next one).
	- **Scouting for Boss rooms** - Each type of a dungeon has a Boss room that is distinct from any other Combat room in shape, and sometimes and sometimes in size - being able to spot them on the minimap can help with deciding which rooms to expolore which results in faster exploration overall.
